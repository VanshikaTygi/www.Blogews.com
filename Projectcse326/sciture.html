    <h3>Environmental Pollution</h3>
    <p> 
        <img src="https://www.theenvironmentalblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/powerplant-emissions.jpg"> <br>
        Environmental pollution is an unfortunate result of our modern day lives. We need to come together to solve the worst impacts of environmental pollution by sorting out the need for environmental health protections with the need for commerce and everyday necessities.<br></p>
        <h4>Air Pollution</h4>
        <h5>Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPS)</h5>
               <p> Hazardous air pollutants are pollutants that are recognized or presumed to cause cancer and/or other other major health issues including birth defects and other reproductive effects.<br>
        Some examples of those pollutants are found in everyday products such as perchlorethlyene, which is typically emitted by non-green dry cleaning businesses, and benzene which is in gasoline.<br>
        <img src="http://www.theenvironmentalblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/car-exhaust-150x150.jpg"><br>
        <b>Common ways people can be exposed to toxic air pollutants:</b><br>
        Water can be contaminated by air pollutants, so drinking it will expose you.<br>
Vegetables and fruits that are grown in soil that is contaminated will expose you to pollutants if consumed.<br>
Making skin contact with contaminated water (think water skiing), soil, or dust.<br>
Inhaling in polluted air (people breathe polluted air everyday).<br>
Once these harmful pollutants enter your body, certain pollutants will tend to build up in your body tissue. This means that humans and other species at the top of the food chain typically are more prone to the build up of toxic pollutants in their bodies. <br></p>
<h5>Known Effects of Environmental Pollution</h5>
<p><img src="http://www.theenvironmentalblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/taiwan-pollution-150x150.jpg"><br>
The known health effects caused by the build of toxic environmental pollution typically lead to increased chances of developing cancer. This all depends on the amount of exposure, duration of exposure, and the concentrations of the exposure.<br>
Health issues can include neurological issues, reduced fertility, damage to the immune system, respiratory issues, and developmental issues.</p>
<h5>Greenhouse Gas Emissions</h5>
<p>Greenhouse gases are gases that retain heat in the atmosphere. This created something called the greenhouse effect. It is normal function of our Earth. There are naturally occurring greenhouse emissions into the atmosphere like carbon dioxide. This happens through normal and natural processes and human activities.There are some greenhouse gases that are only emitted by human activities such as fluorinated gases.<br>
<img src="http://www.theenvironmentalblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/global-warming-150x150.jpg"><br>
Greenhouse gases that release into the atmosphere due to human induced exploits include:<br>
Carbon Dioxide (CO2)<br>
Methane (CH4)<br>
Nitrous Oxide (N2O)<br>
Fluorinated GasesParticulate Matter (PM)</p>

<h4>Water Pollution</h4>
<h5>Pollutant Discharge Elimination System Permits</h5>
<p>If big and small industry had their way, they would pollute and contaminate our water with various chemicals and who knows what else. Thankfully, in the United States, the Clean Water Act enabled the government to create a permit program called the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System. <br>
The NPDES system lead to cleaner drinking water and an overall cleaner environment since its introduction in the United States.</p>

<h5>Polluted Runoff and Stormwater Runoff</h5>
<p><img src="http://www.theenvironmentalblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Dieselrainbow1-150x150.jpg"><br>
Most storm water runoff enters our bodies of water without being treated or scrubbed of pollutants. Real damage can be inflicted on our waterways and micro-ecosystems from polluted stormwater like harm or death to fish. Everyday actions can help reduce the amount of pollution that ends up in our water like driving less, washing your car at a commercial washer, and by having as much vegetated land as possible on your property versus pathways and patios.</p>
<h5>Watershed Management</h5>
<p><img src="http://www.theenvironmentalblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/pollution-swan-sewage-150x150.jpg">
Watershed management is so important to maintain the health our water supply. Many people cities around the world tap into underground reservoirs of water for everyday use from drinking water, to showering, and laundry uses. To help reduce storm water water runoff while simultaneously helping the watershed, everyday people can collect rainwater in barrels for the garden, re-use grey water, or install a full on cistern system with filtration system. <br>
The more people are aware of environmental water pollution issues and water scarcity, the more likely people are to chip-in and do their part.

    <h3>Space Exploration</h3>
    <p>Space exploration is the use of astronomy and space technology to explore outer space. While the exploration of space is currently carried out mainly by astronomers with telescopes, its physical exploration is conducted both by uncrewed robotic space probes and human spaceflight. Space exploration, like its classical form astronomy, is one of the main sources for space science.
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/78/AS11-40-5964_%2821037459754%29.jpg/330px-AS11-40-5964_%2821037459754%29.jpg">
        <br><br>
        While the observation of objects in space, known as astronomy, predates reliable recorded history, it was the development of large and relatively efficient rockets during the mid-twentieth century that allowed physical space exploration to become a reality. Common rationales for exploring space include advancing scientific research, national prestige, uniting different nations, ensuring the future survival of humanity, and developing military and strategic advantages against other countries.
        The launch of the first human-made object to orbit Earth, the Soviet Union's Sputnik 1, on 4 October 1957, and the first Moon landing by the American Apollo 11 mission on 20 July 1969 are often taken as landmarks for this initial period. The Soviet space program achieved many of the first milestones, including the first living being in orbit in 1957, the first human spaceflight (Yuri Gagarin aboard Vostok 1) in 1961, the first spacewalk (by Alexei Leonov) on 18 March 1965, the first automatic landing on another celestial body in 1966, and the launch of the first space station (Salyut 1) in 1971.
        In the 2000s, China initiated a successful crewed spaceflight program while India launched the Chandrayaan programme, while the European Union and Japan have also planned future crewed space missions. The two primary global programs gaining traction in the 2020s are the Chinese-led International Lunar Research Station and the US-led Artemis Program, with its plan to build the Lunar Gateway and the Artemis Base Camp, each having its own set of international partners.
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/Apollo_16_LM_Orion.jpg/330px-Apollo_16_LM_Orion.jpg">
    </p>    
        <h5>First space station</h5>
<p>Salyut 1 was the first space station of any kind, launched into low Earth orbit by the Soviet Union on 19 April 1971. The International Space Station (ISS) is currently the largest and oldest of the 2 current fully functional space stations, inhabited continuously since the year 2000. The other, Tiangong space station built by China, is now fully crewed and operational.</p>
<h5>Deep space exploration</h5>
<p>Deep space exploration is the branch of astronomy, astronautics and space technology that is involved with the exploration of distant regions of outer space. Physical exploration of space is conducted both by human spaceflights (deep-space astronautics) and by robotic spacecraft.
<br><br>
Some of the best candidates for future deep space engine technologies include anti-matter, nuclear power and beamed propulsion.[49] Beamed propulsion, appears to be the best candidate for deep space exploration presently available, since it uses known physics and known technology that is being developed for other purposes.</p>
<h5>Human spaceflight and habitation</h5>
<p> <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/98/Aldrin_Apollo_11_original.jpg/330px-Aldrin_Apollo_11_original.jpg"><br>
    To date, the longest human occupation of space is the International Space Station which has been in continuous use for 23 years, 364 days. Valeri Polyakov's record single spaceflight of almost 438 days aboard the Mir space station has not been surpassed. The health effects of space have been well documented through years of research conducted in the field of aerospace medicine. Analog environments similar to those experienced in space travel (like deep sea submarines), have been used in this research to further explore the relationship between isolation and extreme environments.Beyond the technical factors that could make living in space more widespread, it has been suggested that the lack of private property, the inability or difficulty in establishing property rights in space, has been an impediment to the development of space for human habitation. Since the advent of space technology in the latter half of the twentieth century, the ownership of property in space has been murky, with strong arguments both for and against. In particular, the making of national territorial claims in outer space and on celestial bodies has been specifically proscribed by the Outer Space Treaty, which had been, as of 2012, ratified by all spacefaring nations.[87] Space colonization, also called space settlement and space humanization, would be the permanent autonomous (self-sufficient) human habitation of locations outside Earth, especially of natural satellites or planets such as the Moon or Mars, using significant amounts of in-situ resource utilization.

    <h3>Wildlife Conservation</h3>
    <p>There are hundreds of wildlife species like lions, crocodiles, rhinoceros present in the forest. They usually get hunted for their skins, nails, horns and meat. Skins are used for manufacturing clothes, ropes and many useful items. Human beings kill these animals only to fulfil their needs, which are unnecessary and can be fulfilled by other alternatives. So, preventing wildlife species from uneven poaching and killing is wildlife conservation. It is the distinctive approach for protecting the wildlife on Earth and their habitat so that their future generations can exist without any fear.<br>

    </p>
    <h5>Definition of Wildlife Conservation</h5>
    <p>Wildlife Conservation can be defined as preventing wildlife from uneven killing and poaching. It also involves the practice of making people aware by telling them about the importance of wildlife. Wildlife Conservation is very important to maintain the food chain and ecosystem balance. </p>
    <h5>Importance of Wildlife Conservation</h5>
    <p>Maintain Balance in the Ecosystem <br>
        Maintains Natural Habitat <br>
        Maintains the Food Chain <br>
    </p>
    <h5>Steps for Promoting Wildlife Conservation</h5>
    <p>The governments of different countries form different laws for restricting the hunting of animals<br>
        They also ensure immediate actions if anyone attempts such an act<br>
        Many natural sanctuaries are built to preserve natural habitats for future generations<br>
        To promote the survival of endangered species, many natural parks and sanctuaries provide habitats to endangered animals to breed<br>
        <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRUDk7XteAy4xldBWzDBEVyryX6K5SsZ8f3_A&s"> <br>
        Wildlife Conservation also ensures the protection of natural habitats from pollution and other human activities<br>
        Pollution may ruin the natural environment of animals<br>
        So, the governments of many countries prohibited Industrial work near the forest<br>
        Reduced meat-eating is increasingly being promoted by various organisations, both for the protection of animals and for good health<br>
        Governments of many countries have restricted or even banned hunting<br>
        People have to pay a large fine if they hunt without permission</p>    
        <h5>Importance of Wildlife Sanctuaries</h5>
        <p>Wildlife sanctuaries provide a natural habitat for animals to breed easily. In this way, they help protect the planet’s natural environment. Endangered animals like giant pandas, tigers, whooping cranes, Asian elephants and so forth live in these wildlife sanctuaries. Here, they can enjoy their habitat and can breed easily.
            <br> <img src="https://www.insideindianjungles.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Multicoloured-Modern-World-Wildlife-Day-Facebook-Post-1.jpg"> 
        </p>
        <h5>Conclusion</h5>
        <p>Wildlife conservation is essential to maintain the balance of the ecosystem. It is necessary to protect the rare and extinct species of animals. In India and around the world, there are different wildlife sanctuaries to protect and preserve some distinctively rare animals like Kaziranga National Park, Jim Corbett National Park, Sepilok Orangutan Sanctuary etc. The governments of many countries have implemented strict norms to promote wildlife conservation. The life of human beings without wildlife is impossible on Earth and therefore, wildlife conservation is very significant.</p>
