    <h3> # The real issues of a common man are disappearing from the elections</h3>
    <p>
        <img src="https://www.youthinpolitics.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/WhatsApp-Image-2022-11-21-at-3.15.58-PM.jpeg"> <br>
        Writer: Zaid Chaudhary<br>
        Political parties and their leaders know very well how to trick people. They can also make lies true and sell them, because that is their profession. The general public does not understand. Earlier, poverty, inflation, unemployment, the right price of farmers’ crops, all these issues were raised during elections and governments were formed and fallen on these issues. You must remember how much there was a ruckus on the price of onions once! But the clever players of politics have disappeared these real issues. From the election field and also from the minds of the people.<br> <br>
        
        Corruption is no longer an issue before and after the elections. Why? Because now no opposition party wants to take to the streets and agitate. Even if you do something small, just to take photos and make videos viral. In fact, the plains have now become slaves to WhatsApp and Facebook or say social media. This slavery has been well-built among parties, leaders, workers, even the general public. Election campaigns, speeches, even relationships have now become Facebook. Emotional relationships have been abandoned. No one even found out.<br> <br>
        
        Since the general public, the real voters, have not been aware of the real issues, then how long have the parties been wanting this. The price of petrol, diesel, flour – pulses is no longer known to anyone. It is purchased and the price written on the packet is paid online without asking the price. Since this online money started being transferred, people have stopped feeling inflation. They do not know to what extent the price or price has increased.<br> <br>
        
        They make online payments in bulk and go on. It doesn’t matter! You do practical – you bring ten kilos of flour and pay online, neither do you know the price of kg, nor do you want to ask. Similarly, fill petrol or diesel in the car. Pay three or four thousand rupees. You don’t see the price of liters. This is the reason why clever leaders have disappeared the real issues.<br> <br>
        
        When it does not matter to the public, how will inflation become an issue? How can unemployment become a burning issue when the youth do not know the job struggle? Corruption has mingled everywhere as if it does not matter to anyone. The reason is clear – now everyone is in a hurry. There has to be work. How did it happen? What- what had to be done? No one wants to think about it.
        <br> <br>
        Therefore, in elections, there is no issue now, only caste. If the caste arithmetic is fine, then the candidate wins, otherwise he loses.</p>

        <h3># Article 14- The most important part of our Indian constitution</h3>
        <p> <img src="https://www.youthinpolitics.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/WhatsApp-Image-2022-11-16-at-4.03.13-PM.jpeg">

The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India.<br> <br>

75 years of independence and our country has still not able to gain actual independence, discrimination is still being witnessed on basis like religion, race, sex, caste, place of origin, etc.  In general sense, every citizen of India is capable of understanding Article 14 of the Indian Constitution that is “Right to Equality” The one who created constitution also had a vision that there must not be a class that has got all the privileges and a class that has got all the burdens to carry. Even now there are some places where people are not treated equally and are discriminated on different basis like a girl who is not able to complete her education, lower caste man being shown inferior to upper caste people, husband ill-treating his wife and many more. By analysing the scenario of India our constitution makers added Article 14 in the Indian constitution as a fundamental right to citizens as well those who are a citizen of our country.<br> <br>

Article 14 define no one is above the law; all are equal in eyes of law. Equality before law means a state shall not deny to any person equality before the law. This means that every person, who lives within territory of India, has the equal right before the law.<br> <br>

Our country is the largest democratic country in the world and thus our state is there to put reasonable restriction. The fundamental tenet of liberalism is that all citizens should be treated equally, and Article 14 guarantees this for all of our residents. Any person’s freedom is inversely proportional to the level of equality they have in society. Legal equality is the idea that everyone should be treated equally, regardless of their status—rich or poor, male or female, upper caste or lower caste. To dig deep into the article we mean from the prime minister down to a constable, is under the same responsibility for every act done without any legal justification as any other citizen. The equal protection of law guaranteed by article 14 doesn’t mean that all laws must be general in character. Article 14 permits classification but prohibits class legislation, it doesn’t mean that the same laws should apply to all persons or every law must have universal application for, all. People are not in the same position by nature, achievement, or circumstance.<br> <br>

As Dr. Jennings rightly quoted “equality before the law means that among equals the law should be equal and should be equally administered, that like should be treated alike. The right to sue and be sued to prosecute and prosecuted for the same kind of action should be same for all citizens of full age and understanding without distinctions of race, religion, wealth, social status or political influence.” Right to equality is a one of the most important part of our Indian constitution that strengthens all those who belong to our nationality.

    <h3> # EWS: A ladder for the weak or for supremacists?</h3>
    <p>
        <img src="https://www.youthinpolitics.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/EWS.jpg"> <br>
        Writer: Aarti Rajput<br>

Diversity is generally admired from in and outside India but it has become a curse for many living here. It is a common misconception that the upper caste has a long history of exploiting the lower caste and doesn’t exist now. Discrimination’s scars are still as fresh and green as ever. There is no disputing that we live in a developed nation where caste is not as strictly observed as it once was, yet it still exists in the interior of India, commonly known as the real India. The print states quote questions upper caste people generally asked: When you have a good job, why do you support reservations? (‘Caste prejudice doesn’t stop with Dalit’s having a good job.) <br> <br>

Caste-based discrimination continues to exist, and new forms of it have also been identified. I’ll quote from the print piece to demonstrate this action. “You don’t look Dalit’ and other things ‘upper castes’ must stop saying to Dalits immediately”. The modern methods of prejudice and discomforting disadvantaged individuals in public are discussed in this article. These contemporary forms of oppression and exploitation are severe enough to disturb one’s mental equilibrium.<br> <br>

Recently while reading a story one of my colleagues encouraged me to write this article. The story said, “Caste privilege doesn’t mean that upper castes don’t struggle, it means their struggles aren’t because of their caste.” <br> <br>

Understandably, the upper caste must be having difficulties; after all, as human beings, we are all entitled to experience difficulties in our lives. However, I think it’s important to remember the intersectional disparities, inequalities, and injustices. Every one of us can see that underprivileged community face multiple forms of oppression: first, due to their caste. Second, due to their economic hardship; third, due to the mental trauma caused by their genetic heritage; and fourth, due to the gender of socio-economically disadvantaged females.  This socially disadvantaged community struggles in many ways that they are not even responsible for, such as everyday challenges. These communities must contend with hardships brought on by both their social and economic capital. <br> <br>

In my opinion, if an upper caste or so-called privileged class is having difficulties it must be their incapability. There is no disputing the upper caste’s continued utilization of resources and other means due to their social standing. Therefore, if anyone is struggling now, it must be because they were not participating in creating their economic capital. Even if it was due to an accident or catastrophe, they would still be able to maintain their reputation in society as they are more accepted in society, unlike Dalits or Bahujan, Due to all available resources, their kids have access to a decent education, a fulfilling existence, and the resources necessary to develop to their full potential. If any member of this group is not in the same position, it must be due to that person’s or his elders’ incapacity or laziness in using those measures. <br> <br>

My point is, should the state make up for someone who has had all the means and resources to succeed but has been unable to do so for years? Is it the state’s responsibility if someone is unable to achieve something? No, if that is the case, then in addition to reservations, we should have additional protections for disadvantaged groups and impoverished communities. Because despite possessing this reservation, these people still struggle to gain recognition in high-profile roles and settings.<br> <br>

The second question don’t you think this EWS reservation gives another way to the upper caste to come into the same dominant position? As the entire nation is not good in terms of income but the condition of disadvantaged communities is worse than EWS-entitled people.<br> <br>

The introduction of reservations in the nation coincided with an increase in the visibility of underprivileged people in public life, which they had long been denied. Although the higher caste in India has long found reservations to be an eyesore. The only reason India’s upper caste is currently poor is that they might be incapable to raise their standard of living after having all means without any social barriers.<br> <br>

I consider that the purpose of the reservation was to increase the participation and visibility of socially disadvantaged people, which was undermined by this economically deficient area of the reservation. I see the EWS reservation as giving the higher class a different opportunity to hold positions that they would otherwise be unable to have due to their financial situation. Those members of the upper caste who are financially secure can maintain their presence by their means, while those who are not financially secure will rule thanks to the EWS reservation. However, no one in India believes that providing the underprivileged groups SC/ST/ OBC 16%, 7.5%, and 25% reservation is unfair given that they make up the bulk of the population and these folks are in competition with one another. However, upper castes who are not good in that number and have these kinds of reservations can easily occupy dominant holdings.<br> <br>

I’d like to leave you with a question. If you believe India should entirely abolish caste-based reservation. First, ask yourself if caste prejudice still exists in our nation.

    <h3> # Some more Brics, but not a Chinese-Iranian wall</h3>
    <p>Ups and downs over the last decade aside, the original Brics – Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa – worked together to chart out significant initiatives such as establishment of New Development Bank and Contingency Reserve Agreement. Its five new members – Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and UAE – should ideally infuse fresh thinking. This is sorely needed. Brics has slowed in the face of rivalries within on catalysing reforms in multilateral institutions and has squandered opportunities to impact the world stage.<br>
        <img src="https://static.toiimg.com/imagenext/toiblogs/photo/blogs/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Untitled-design-63.png"> <br>
        Each country has its agenda, but the Chinese desire has been to use the forum to increase their global influence particularly among the Global South, as well as thwart ambitions of India, Brazil and South Africa to play a bigger role in global governance, especially at UN Security Council. This has undermined the group’s effectiveness. The Russia summit (Oct 22 to 24) provides an expanded Brics the opportunity to break out of the rut. This makes India’s role even more crucial; it has to be an enthusiastic player.
