    <li><b>News :- </b>Kartik Aaryan says he is burnt out: Don't know anything else but work</li>
    <p><b>Blog :- </b><br> Bollywood star Kartik Aaryan recently opened up about his work and said that he is so focused on his career that he doesn't care about the noise that surrounds him.<br>
    <img src="https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202410/kartik-aaryan-263620216-16x9_0.jpg?VersionId=6q2S2H60YEdW1qJnd4lZo8rGWiOxd8Ec&size=690:388"> <br>
    In Short<br>
Kartik Aaryan admits being a workaholic and feels burnt out<br>
He reflects on never enjoying his first film break<br>
Kartik's next film, Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3, releases on November 1<br>
Bollywood star Kartik Aaryan has been doing back-to-back projects, without a long break. The actor is admittedly exhausted but still doesn't want to stop because he is laser-focused on the next thing.<br> <br>

Speaking to Indianexpress.com, the actor shared, "I just went for it, the film released, then the second film didn’t work and then Sonu Ke Titu Ki Sweety revived my career, almost like a re-launch. Success, failures, everything kept happening. Even till today, I haven’t gotten the chance to relax and think, I’ve come this farâ€æI haven’t had the chance to sit and back reflect, because I am in a race with no finish line."<br> <br>

When asked about why he didn't take some time to enjoy his first break, Kartik said, "I don’t think I am able to give myself that personal time, because I am always thinking about work, the way forward, what I have not done, what went wrong, what is right. I have been in that space for the longest time. I think I need time for myself also. I am getting a bit burnt out with this — just constantly been working. But the thing is, I don’t know anything else but work. I’ve tried that, but it doesn’t work for me. I am a workaholic x 100." <br> <br>

On the work front, Kartik will next be seen in Anees Bazmee's horror-comedy, Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3, co-starring Triptii Dimri, Vidya Balan, Madhuri Dixit, Rajpal Yadav and Sanjay Mishra among others.<br>

It releases in cinemas on November 1.

    <li><b>News :- </b>Singham Again vs Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3: Studios battle for screens, win-win for audience</li>
    <p><b>Blog :- </b><br> Singham Again and Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 are set for a Diwali clash, but would it affect the business of the films? Film business analysts and experts weigh in.<br>
    <img src="https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/indiatoday/images/story/202410/bhool-bhulaiyaa-3-crosses-rs-1-crore-in-advance-booking--singham-again-keeping-up-29502023-16x9_1.jpg?VersionId=oltTm17rpmid2M2uSRaKZ8h9vc7bq.fc&size=690:388"> <br>
    In Short<br>
    Both films are expected to attract large audiences despite competition<br>
    Industry experts predict a lucrative Diwali weekend for Bollywood, with potential combined earnings of Rs 200–250 crore
    The films, however, won't be able to wash away the craze of South biggies like Amaran and Lucky Baskhar in home ground
    Firecrackers would be shot at the box office when Singham Again and Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 drop on Diwali. While Ajay Devgn and Rohit Shetty are coming back together after 10 years with their popular franchise, Kartik Aaryan's Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 has an upper hand given how the horror-comedy genre has been blessed with the Midas touch. Singham Again brings together Rohit Shetty's entire cop universe including Ranveer Singh, Akshay Kumar and Deepika Padukone, while Bhool Bhulaiyaa 3 will have Vidya Balan and Madhuri Dixit's face-off as the two 'Manjulika'. Even though it's going to be a tough battle for both films, industry experts believe that audiences will have the last laugh, enjoying these massive entertainers in theatres.
