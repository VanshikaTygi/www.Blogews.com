    <li><b>News :- </b>NASA Launches Europa Clipper Mission To Explore Jupiter's Ice-Covered Moon For Signs Of Life, Habitability</li>
    <p><b>Blog :- </b><br> NASA's Europa Clipper mission launched on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket, embarking on a journey to Jupiter's moon Europa, an icy world suspected of harboring a potential ocean and ingredients for life.<br>
        By : ABP News Bureau | Updated at : 14 Oct 2024 10:42 PM (IST)<br>
    <img src="https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2024/10/14/00fcd5b5219e7b77fbeb0e335e5478cc172892534308125_original.jpg?impolicy=abp_cdn&imwidth=1200&height=675"> <br>
    The Europa Clipper is equipped with nine science instruments and a gravity experiment, aiming to investigate the ocean believed to exist beneath Europa's thick ice shell. Scientists estimate this ocean could contain twice as much liquid water as Earth's oceans. The spacecraft will fly by Europa 49 times, coming as close as 16 miles (25 kilometres) from its surface.<br>

“The instruments work together hand in hand to answer our most pressing questions about Europa,” said Robert Pappalardo, project scientist for the mission at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. “We will learn what makes Europa tick, from its core and rocky interior to its ocean and ice shell to its very thin atmosphere and the surrounding space environment.”<br> <br>

Europa Clipper: NASA's Mission Overview And Trajectory<br>
With its massive solar arrays, Europa Clipper is the largest spacecraft ever built by NASA for a planetary mission, spanning over 100 feet (30.5 metres). It is expected to begin orbiting Jupiter in April 2030 and will conduct its flybys over a year starting in 2031. The spacecraft will loop around Mars and Earth, gaining speed as it heads towards Jupiter, covering a distance of approximately 1.8 billion miles (2.9 billion kilometres).<br> <br>

NASA’s official statement highlighted that “Its sights are set on Jupiter’s ice-encased moon Europa, which the spacecraft will fly by 49 times, coming as close as 16 miles (25 kilometres) from the surface as it searches for ingredients of life.” <br> <br>

After lifting off from historic Launch Complex 39A, the Falcon Heavy's side boosters separated, followed by the core stage being expended into the Atlantic Ocean. The second stage fired its engine to help Europa Clipper escape Earth’s gravity. Around 50 minutes after launch, the payload fairing separated from the rocket, and the spacecraft separated from the upper stage about an hour post-launch. Stable communication with the spacecraft was expected to be established approximately 19 minutes after separation.<br> <br>

About three hours after liftoff, Europa Clipper deployed its solar arrays and directed them towards the Sun. Mission controllers are set to reconfigure the spacecraft for its operational mode over the next three months. This phase includes a commissioning period to ensure all systems are functioning as expected.

Pichai expressed his excitement in a post on X (formerly Twitter), commenting on the record-breaking feat that advances Musk’s ambitious mission to Mars. "Huge congrats, have to admit, rewatched the video many times over, incredible to see!" Pichai wrote in response to a video Musk shared, where the SpaceX founder triumphantly announced, "The tower has caught the rocket!!"<br> <br>

    Huge congrats, have to admit, rewatched the video many times over, incredible to see!<br> <br>

    Joining in the celebration, Demis Hassabis, co-founder of Google DeepMind and a recent Nobel Prize winner in Chemistry, also praised the accomplishment with a simple yet enthusiastic post:<br> <br>
    
    Awesome !! Huge congrats!<br> <br>
    
    — Demis Hassabis (@demishassabis) October 13, 2024<br> <br>
    
    Meanwhile, Anand Mahindra, Chairman of Mahindra Group, was equally thrilled by the achievement. Sharing a video on X, Mahindra showcased the impressive moment when the lower half of Musk’s Starship — during its fifth test flight — made a flawless return to its launch tower. Captured mid-air by giant mechanical arms, known as “chopsticks,” this landing represents a historic breakthrough in reusable rocket technology. In a playful nod to Musk’s space vision, Mahindra quipped, “Where can I buy my ticket, @elonmusk?”<br> <br>
    
    And this Sunday, I’m happy to be a couch potato, if it means that I get to watch history being made.<br> <br>
    
    This experiment may just be the critical moment when space travel was democratised and made routine.

    <li><b>News :- </b>Stadium-Sized Asteroid 2024 RV50 Approaching Earth On October 18, NASA Warns</li>
    <p><b>Blog :- </b><br> NASA-JPL Alert: Asteroid 2024 RV50, measuring 710 feet, will make a close approach to Earth on October 18, 2024, passing at a distance of 4.61 million miles.<br>
        By : ABP News Bureau | Updated at : 18 Oct 2024 01:31 AM (IST) <br>
    <img src="https://feeds.abplive.com/onecms/images/uploaded-images/2024/10/18/ccf08d7d88c912cb861452029301c40a1729195016751236_original.jpg?impolicy=abp_cdn&imwidth=1200&height=675"> <br>
    Asteroid Alert: In a cosmic reminder of the ever-present watchful eye of astronomers, NASA has flagged an asteroid, named 2024 RV50, that will make a close approach to Earth on October 18, 2024. Measuring approximately 710 feet/216 metres (roughly the length of a stadium), this asteroid will pass at a distance of 4.61 million miles from Earth, well beyond the orbit of the Moon.<br> <br>

Although this distance might sound vast, 2024 RV50 falls into the category of a near-Earth object (NEO) — a term used to define any celestial object that ventures close to Earth's orbit. <br> <br>

Similar to a recent asteroid named 2024 ON, which captured public attention in July, NASA's monitoring of 2024 RV50 is part of an ongoing planetary defence initiative. According to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), which tracks asteroids and comets that are supposed to make relatively close approaches to Earth, this global effort relies on both ground-based and space-based telescopes to track thousands of such objects annually, helping scientists keep tabs on potential hazards.<br> <br>

Why Significant Impacts Of Asteroids Are Rare<br>
While the idea of a large asteroid approaching Earth may evoke anxiety, experts emphasise that significant impacts are rare. "On a daily basis we are visited by many objects," Juan Luis Cano from the European Space Agency's Planetary Defense Office is quoted as saying in a Deutsche Welle report. Most of these objects, however, are small fragments that burn up upon entering Earth's atmosphere.<br> <br>

For the few asteroids that could pose real danger, early tracking systems offer valuable lead time. NASA's Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART), for example, successfully altered the trajectory of an asteroid last year, demonstrating a potential defence strategy for deflecting future threats. Later this month, the European Space Agency will launch the Hera mission to study the aftermath of this DART mission, enhancing our understanding of asteroid deflection methods.<br> <br>

With over 34,000 NEOs cataloged and advanced telescopes like the Near-Earth Object Surveyor and Vera Rubin Observatory coming online soon, scientists are more equipped than ever to detect and monitor such objects. For now, though, 2024 RV50 poses no threat and serves as a reminder of the extensive precautions already in place to keep our planet safe from cosmic threats.

    NASA astronauts Sunita Williams and Barry 'Butch' Wilmore said they are happy that they got this extra time in space to continue research and other work. Though they are missing home, they are aboard the International Space Station "working with friends", and are looking forward to the next few months with great excitement. Both astronauts addressed the media from the ISS late Friday, and shared their experiences during the ongoing mission that got extended after the Boeing Starliner spacecraft that took them to the orbiting lab developed faults and was brought back to Earth uncrewed.<br> <br>

    Williams and Wilmore will now return only in February 2025 aboard a SpaceX Dragon capsule. This was the second time they were speaking from the space during the current mission.   <br> <br>
    
    Sunita Williams, who will be spending her birthday in space in the coming week, has been named the International Space Station (ISS) commander, Wilmore shared. <br> <br>
    
    As the question-answer round started, and the two astronauts were asked to speak about the ups and downs they have faced so far during their mission, Wilmore replied: "Well, Suni Williams has just been named the commander of the space station. She'll take over in a couple of weeks. I'm gonna let her start off with some questions."<br> <br>
    
    Williams said: "We work here with our friends, and that's key part of being at the International Space Station, and doing our work... The 'up' part is we are working with our friends, and we have got a ride home, and we are looking forward to the next couple of months and doing a lot of stuff at the station."
